## Logistics
- Running a meeting
  > Running meetings properly is a rare skill, so we’ve summarized the key
    points here – this particular skill is valuable in most walks of life.
    Several days before the meeting, the organizer of the meeting should:
      • circulate the agenda;
      • check that the venue is still available, if it isn’t the supervisor’s office;
      • remind people of the time and place of the meeting;
      • circulate any briefing material, including minutes of the last meeting.
    During the meeting, the chair of the meeting should:
      • record the date and the parties present;
      • check that everyone agrees with the minutes of the last meeting;
      • check that actions from the last meeting have all been done;
      • record any decisions made, including milestones and deliverables (and check that everyone agrees with this record);
      • record any actions agreed (and check that everyone agrees with this record);
      • fix the time and place of the next meeting.
    After the meeting:
      • the organizer should write up the minutes and distribute them;
      • everyone should do what they have agreed to do.
