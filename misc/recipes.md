## Baked Goods

### Bagels
```
1 cup unbleached all purpose flour, whole wheat or gluten-free mix* ((5 oz in weight))
2 teaspoons baking powder (make sure it's not expired or it won't rise)
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt (use less if using table salt)
1 cup non-fat Greek yogurt (not regular yogurt, it will be too sticky (Stonyfield))
1 egg white or whole egg (beaten)
optional toppings: everything bagel seasoning, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried garlic flakes, dried onion flakes**

Preheat oven to 375F. Place parchment paper or a silpat on a baking sheet. If using parchment paper, spray with oil to avoid sticking.

In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk well. Add the yogurt and mix with a fork or spatula until well combined, it will look like small crumbles.

Lightly dust flour on a work surface and remove dough from the bowl, knead the dough a few times until dough is tacky, but not sticky, about 15 turns (it should not leave dough on your hand when you pull away).

Divide into 4 equal balls. Roll each ball into 3/4-inch thick ropes and join the ends to form bagels. (or you can make a ball and poke a hole in the center then stretch it slightly)

Top with egg wash and sprinkle both sides with seasoning of your choice. Bake on the top rack of the oven for 25 minutes. Let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting.

### Chinese Sticky Rice Cake
```
(16 ounce) box sweet rice flour (mochiko)
1 cup canola oil
2 ½ cups milk
1 ½ cups white sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 eggs, beaten
½ (18.75 ounce) can sweetened red bean paste
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.

Mix rice flour, canola oil, milk, sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl. Stir in the beaten eggs. Pour the mixture into the baking pan. Drop small spoonfuls of the red bean paste into the flour mixture about 1 to 2 inches apart, making sure that the red bean paste is covered by the flour mixture. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
```

### Cinnamon Swirl Protein Cake
```
¼ cup oats
1 egg white
1 scoop vanilla protein powder
2 tsp. Stevia
½ tbsp. cinnamon
⅓ Cup water

Preheat the oven to 325 F (165 C)

Blend the oats, egg white, and water until the consistency is smooth (I use a Nutribullet)

Pour the mixture into a bowl. Whisk it together with the protein powder and 1 tsp. Stevia. The mixture should be like thick pancake batter.

Pour half of the batter into a small (about 4.5 inches across) nonstick pan and sprinkle with two-thirds of the cinnamon plus 1 tsp. Stevia. Pour the remaining batter and sprinkle with the rest of the cinnamon.

Pull a knife through the batter a few times to slightly mix in the cinnamon and Stevia.

Bake for 25 minutes and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.

NOTE: Add 1 tsp of baking powder, and whip egg before folding in the rest of the ingredients

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
pinch of sea salt
1 cup of unsweetened almond milk (or water)
1/2 Tablespoon chopped walnuts
1 Tablespoon almond butter or another type of nut butter

Add oats, banana, zucchini, cinnamon and sea salt to a medium pot. Add almond milk/water and stir to combine. Heat over medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed. Be sure to stir the oats several times while cooking to make sure the banana slices melt into the oats and oats don’t stick to the pot. You’ll know the oatmeal is done when all the liquid is absorbed and the oats are thick and fluffy.

Portion oats into a bowl, top with chopped walnuts and almond butter and enjoy!

Line an 8×12″ aluminum or nonstick baking dish with parchment paper.

Add the butter and half of the semisweet chocolate chips to a large, microwave-safe bowl. Save remaining chocolate for later.

Microwave in 20 second intervals until the chocolate is fully melted and combined, stirring in-between. Add the sugars and oil to the chocolate mixture and stir until well combined and the sugars have mostly dissolved. Allow to cool until just slightly warm to the touch.

Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, and instant coffee granules. Whip until thick and fluffy.

Sift in the flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt, and mix. Continue to fold in using a flexible baking spatula.

Once well-combined, fold in the remaining chocolate chips. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.

Bake until brownies are glossy on top but very soft and not fully set, about 30-35 minutes. Allow to cool fully before slicing so the brownies firm up and set.

### Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies with Sea Salt
```
  2 cups white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour
  1 teaspoon baking powder
  1 teaspoon baking soda
  ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
  100g chocolate chips
  1 cup of sugar (half white sugar, half brown cane sugar)
  ½ cup coconut oil/vegetable oil
  3T water
  Maldon flaky sea salt for sprinkling (optional)


Microwave the coconut oil for 15 seconds until liquid, then mix with the sugars and the water.

Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt.

Add the chocolate chips and nuts if using.

Shape the dough into balls and let it rest in the fridge overnight. Trust me, I've tried the 30 minute freezer technique too, and a 12 hour fridge rest is MUCH, MUCH better.

Preheat the oven to 175C (350F) and bake the cookies until the edges are browning (15-16 minutes).

Take them out of the oven. Slide the parchment paper (with cookies) off the baking tray onto your kitchen counter. They will cool quicker that way (vs. leaving them on the sheet pan). Sprinkle some sea salt on top.

Try to think about something else for 10 whole minutes whilst your cookies are setting (this is the hardest step of the entire recipe).

## Drinks

### Boba Milk Tea

```
FOR THE SYRUP
1 cup (240 milliliters) water
1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
1 cup (200 grams) lightly packed light or dark brown sugar

FOR THE BUBBLE TEA
6 tablespoons light or dark brown sugar
1/4 cup (60 milliliters) water, plus more as needed
1/4 teaspoon black food coloring (optional)
1/2 cup (70 grams) tapioca flour or tapioca starch, divided, plus more for dusting and as needed
5 to 6 cups (1220 to 1440 milliliters) strong black or green tea, hot or chilled
Cream, milk or condensed milk, to taste (optional)

Step 1
Make the syrup: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the water with the granulated and brown sugars and stir until the mixture dissolves. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Transfer the syrup to a 2-cup plastic or glass container, cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour, or until thoroughly chilled.

Step 2
Make the tapioca balls: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the brown sugar and water and, stirring constantly, bring to a rolling boil. Add the food coloring, if using, and stir to combine, then add 1/4 cup (35 grams) of tapioca flour and stir vigorously with a large metal spoon until a very sticky paste forms. It’s okay if the paste is lumpy.
Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining tapioca flour, until thoroughly combined.

Step 3
Sprinkle some tapioca flour onto a clean, dry counter and transfer the paste onto the floured surface. (The easiest way to do this is by scooping the paste with a metal spoon and using a silicone spatula to push the paste onto the counter.) Let the paste cool until it can be handled, about 5 minutes.

Step 4
Knead the paste until dough-like and form it into a ball. The paste will be very sticky, so keep it well floured. Work out as many of the lumps as possible. If the paste is too dry and crusty, add cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time. If it’s too wet, add more flour, 1 teaspoon at a time. The paste should spring back when gently poked with a finger.

Step 5
Separate the paste into three equal pieces, and roll each piece into logs slightly less than 1/4-inch wide. Dust the logs with tapioca flour and cut the dough evenly, into cubes slightly less than 1/4-inch wide.
Roll each cube between the palms of your hands to form small balls. If the dough is too dry and difficult to shape, lightly dampen your hands first. Once the balls are formed, coat them with a thin dusting of tapioca flour to prevent them from sticking together.

Step 6
Fill a medium pot three-quarters of the way with water and, over high heat, bring to a rolling boil.
Using either a fine-mesh strainer or your hand, shake the excess flour off the tapioca balls and drop the balls into the boiling water (you’ll need 20 balls per serving). Gently stir with a metal spoon to make sure the balls do not stick together, and boil until they float to the top and become translucent, 10 to 12 minutes.

Step 7
Drain the tapioca balls and briefly rinse with cold, running water so they don’t stick together. Transfer them to a clean jar and use enough of the chilled sugar syrup to submerge them. Allow to soak for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.

Step 8
To make the bubble tea, add about 20 balls per 1 cup of strong, brewed tea. Serve hot or cold and with cream, milk, condensed milk or additional sugar syrup, if desired. (If you prefer your bubble tea cold, brew the tea in advance, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.)

## Meat/Meat Substitute Dishes

### Baked Chicken Wings
```
Here's the recipe, from https://hostthetoast.com/crispy-baked-chicken-wings/ (more details there on ingredients + method, if you're interested! I'll be adding the nutrition label there as well!)

INGREDIENTS
3 pounds chicken wingettes (or divided chicken wings)

2 tablespoons baking powder

2 teaspoons paprika

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon salt

Buffalo sauce, blue cheese, ranch, or other sauces, to serve (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 250°F and move the oven rack to the lower-middle position. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Spray the wire rack lightly with nonstick spray to prevent the wings from sticking.

Dab the chicken wings with a paper towel to dry them. In a large freezer bag or bowl, combine the chicken wings, baking powder, paprika, garlic powder, and salt, and toss to coat the wings well. Arrange the chicken wings on the wire rack, skin side up.

Bake on the lower-middle rack for 30 minutes.

Increase the temperature to 425°F, and move the oven rack to the upper position. Continue to bake the wings until crisp, about 45 minutes to an hour more, rotating the baking sheet halfway through.

Toss with sauce, if desired, and serve warm.

### Brussels Sprout Pad Thai
```
A naughty little alternative to your traditional Pad Thai.

Cooking Time (Includes Preparation Time): 30 Minutes
Feeds: 4 People

Ingredients:
500g Brussel Sprouts
225g Block of Smoked Tofoo
1 Lime
2 Cloves of Garlic
2 Tbsp Tamarind Paste
3 Tbsp Soy Sauce
2 Tbsp Soft Brown Sugar
400g Wide Flat Rice Noodles
2 Tbsp Chilli Oil With Sediment (we used Lee Kum Kee)
200g Beansprouts
Handful Salted Roasted Peanuts
Bunch of Coriander
Vegetable Oil

Method:

Trim the bases off the brussel sprouts and cut them in half. Cut the tofu into roughly 1cm squares. Cut the lime into four wedges. Finely chop the garlic cloves.

For the sauce, mix together the tamarind, soy and soft brown sugar. Set aside.

Soak the rice noodles in a large bowl full of hot water for 10 minutes.

While the noodles are soaking, get a wok or large frying pan over a high heat. Pour in some vegetable oil. Add the sprouts. Stir fry for 3-4 minutes until beginning to soften and lightly colour then scrape in the garlic. Cook for 1 minute more.

Scrape the brussels and garlic to one side of the pan. Pour in a splash more oil and add the tofu. Fry for 2-3 minutes until beginning to crisp then turn the heat to the lowest whilst you drain the noodles.

Get the pan back on the heat, tip in the drained noodles along with a splash of water. Give everything a good mix, fry for 2 minutes then pour in the sauce. Cook for a further 2 minutes until the noodles are soft enough to eat then add the beansprouts, chilli oil, and most of the peanuts to the pan.

Give everything one last toss then dish the Pad Thai into bowls. Top with the remaining peanuts and some torn coriander. You’re ready to plate up and tuck in!

Finely dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add all three to a large skillet along with the olive oil and sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent (about 3 minutes). Add the spice mix and continue to sauté for one more minute.
Add the frozen cauliflower florets to the skillet with the aromatics and spices, and continue to sauté for about 5 minutes more, or until the cauliflower have thawed through and are completely coated in spices.
Add the drained chickpeas, tomato sauce, and 1/4 cup water to the skillet. Stir to combine, then allow them to simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. This will help mellow the acidity of the tomato sauce and allow the spices to blend. If the mixture becomes too dry as it simmers, add a couple more tablespoons of water.
After the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, turn off the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Give the masala a taste and add salt as needed. Serve in a bowl either over rice or with a piece of bread for dipping.

### Gyros
```
I make a couple loaves of gyro meat and slice and freeze them in serving portions in snack-size ziplock bags. They defrost in the skillet while you warm them.

    4 pounds ground beef and/or lamb
    1 large onion peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
    2 tbs minced garlic
    1 tbs oregano
    1 tbs thyme
    2 1/2 tsp ground cumin
    2 tsp kosher salt
    2 tsp ground black pepper
    1 tsp rosemary

Place the onion chunks in a food processor and blitz them until they are super finely chopped. Scrape into the center of a clean tea or flour sack towel, twist and squeeze it over the sink to remove any extra moisture. Use your hands to combine them with the remaining gyro meat ingredients. Cover with plastic wrap and let the mixture rest for at least 1 hour but up to overnight in the refrigerator.

Preheat the oven to 325°F and bring a pot of water to a boil.

Working in batches, pulse the meat mixture for a minute, or until it is a tacky, thick paste. Press it a little at a time into loaf pans, taking care to eliminate any air pockets. You should have enough meat to fill 2 standard bread loaf pans. Press down firmly on the surface of the meat to even it out. Place a wet kitchen towel on the bottom of a large roasting pan and position the loaf pans on top of it. Pour the boiling water into the roasting pan. It should be 2/3 of the way up the outsides of the loaf pans. Carefully transfer the roasting pan into the oven and bake for 50-70 minutes, or until the meat measures 165°F on an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf.

Carefully remove the loaf pans from the roasting pan and pour off any fat that accumulated. Put the loaf pan on a heat-proof surface (a cooling rack or a pan on top of the oven) and place a foil wrapped brick directly on the surface of the meat. Let the meat rest like this for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the brick, run a knife around the edge of the loaves, then gently turn the loaves out. Wrap them tightly with plastic wrap and chill for several hours or overnight to allow them to firm for easier slicing.

### Japanese Curry
```
While waiting for IT to help my employer better surveil my work computer yesterday afternoon, I fell down a YouTube rabbit hole that led from Ochikeron's to Adam Liaw's videos for Japanese curry. The mashup in my head turned out delicious, and took about 40 minutes from prep to plate – about the time it took to watch both videos. Btw, I found the Quorn too mushy; when I make this again, I'll reconstitute some Butler soy curls, which would also make the dish vegan.

The vegetables and curry are cooked separately, in a large saucepan and a cast iron pot, respectively, while 1 cup of jasmine rice was going in the rice cooker.

1 tbsp curry powder (I used Penzey's hot, but any will do)
1 package Quorn meatless strips

2 medium potatoes (13.58 oz), cut rangiri style
3 carrots (11.28 oz), cut rangiri style
water to cover

1 tbsp oil
1 tbsp flour
1 tbsp curry powder
2 cloves garlic
1" cube ginger
1 medium onion (5.47 oz), sliced into thin wedges
1 tbsp ketchup
2 tbsp soy sauce
salt and pepper to taste

First, cook rice while prepping potatoes, carrots, and onions.

Toss Quorn strips with curry powder and set aside. In a large saucepan, cover potatoes and carrots with water and 1 tsp salt. Bring to simmer and reduce heat. Simmer for 10 minutes while making curry. In Dutch oven, heat oil, flour, and curry powder, mixing and toasting well on low heat. Grate in ginger and garlic. Add onions and cook through. Add Quorn, ketchup, and soy sauce, and mix well. Ladle cooking liquid from potatoes and carrots into curry mixture, stirring to prevent clumping. Continue until root veg are almost dry, then tip them all in. Salt and pepper to taste. Stir, then cover to simmer about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Ladle over rice. (But the rest is going on French fries!)

### Korean Fried "Chicken" (Cauliflower)
```
2 quarts vegetable or peanut oil
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup toasted sesame seeds, plus more for garnish
1/3 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
Kosher salt
1/2 cup cold water
1/2 cup vodka
1 head cauliflower, cut into 1-inch florets
1 recipe Sweet Soy Sauce or Sweet and Spicy Chili Sauce
4 to 5 Finely sliced scallions

1. Preheat oil to 350°F in a large wok, Dutch oven, or deep fryer.
2. Combine cornstarch, flour, baking powder, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, sesame seeds, and coconut in a large bowl and whisk until homogenous. Add water and vodka and whisk until a smooth batter is formed, adding up to 2 tablespoons additional water if batter is too thick. It should have the consistency of thin paint and fall off of the whisk in thin ribbons that instantly disappear as they hit the surface of the batter in the bowl.
3. Add cauliflower to batter. Working one at a time, lift one piece and allow excess batter to drip off. Carefully lower into hot oil. Repeat with remaining cauliflower until wok or fryer is full. Do not crowd pan. (You'll be able to fit about half of the cauliflower in each batch). Fry, using a metal spider or slotted spatula to rotate and agitate pieces as they cook until evenly golden brown and crisp all over, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season immediately with salt. Keep warm while you fry the remaining cauliflower.
4. Toss fried cauliflower with sauce and serve immediately, sprinkled with extra sesame seeds and scallions.

### Lentejas (Bita's Recipe)
```
Ingredients: 4 servings
¼	lb	Bacon
1	Large, ripe Tomato (preferably vine ripened) - diced
½	Large Spanish onion - chopped
2	tsps	Minced garlic
		    Salt
		    Ground white pepper
		    Ground cumin
1 Large baking potato - diced
1½ cup	Lentils (about ½ package)
4 oz	Spanish chorizo (in case of need, substitute the chorizo with kielbasa), cut into ½-inch long pieces

Place lentils in a bowl and cover with water. After a few minutes discard the ones that float and drain them.

Fry bacon in saucepan until crisp.  Remove half the fat it releases.  In remaining fat sauté onion and garlic for about 10 mins.  Add lentils and tomato and sauté for a couple of minutes.  Add 3 cups of water, potatoes, salt and pepper (to taste) and boil until lentils are tender.  Watch while boiling to make sure water does not dry up. Add the chorizo (or kielbasa) once the lentils are tender.

Lentejas are served with white rice (preferably Goya long grain, not basmati, brown, whole grain nor jasmine rice). And here is a twist:

In our family some prefer the lentejas on the plate with the rice on top.
Others prefer the rice on the plate and the lentejas on top.
And then there are those who prefer it precisely the opposite way than how you served them.
As a last resort, serve them side by side (or side by each as they would say in Rhode Island) and let each one decide which he wants on top.

Important footnote: If the lentejas are for Diego do NOT use onion. Also, keep in mind his serving is equal to two servings.

### Mongolian Cauliflower
```
BATTER
½ cup (45 g) chickpea flour + 1/8 cup
1 tablespoon (5 g) nutritional yeast
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
¼ teaspoon black pepper
½ cup water
½ cup panko or bread crumbs of choice

SAUCE
½ cup soy sauce
½ cup water
6 large medjool dates
1 Tbsp onion flakes
1 tsp garlic powder
grated ginger to taste

INSTRUCTIONS

    Preheat the oven to 425 Fahrenheit.

    Prepare 1 lb of cauliflower by cutting into “two bite”-sized pieces. Set aside.

    In a very large bowl, combine the chickpea flour, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt. Stir in ¼ cup of water to form a paste. If the mixture is too thick, add another tablespoon of water. If it’s too thin, add a bit more chickpea flour.

    With a rubber spatula, stir the cauliflower into the seasoned chickpea flour paste. Continue to stir for a minute or two, trying to get the cauliflower completely coated. Sprinkle on rice crumbs, and gently stir to coat.

    Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper, and distribute the cauliflower evenly, making sure none of the “wings” are touching.

    Bake for 15 minutes at 425 F. Turn over each “wing” and bake for another 15 minutes.

    While the cauliflower bakes, prepare the teriyaki sauce by blending all ingredients together

    Remove the cauliflower from the oven, and gently toss the cauliflower in the sauce, being careful not to break off the breading.

    Serve immediately with a side of rice, top with sesame seeds and green onion

### Samosas

```
Boil 300g/10oz of potatoes until soft. Meanwhile, thaw 200g/8oz of frozen peas in warm water. Mash the potatoes.

Heat some oil in a pan and add 1tsp cumin seeds. When those pop, add 1 finely diced onion, 1 finely chopped green chili pepper, and 1tbs grated ginger. When the onions have browned, add the powdered spices: 1tsp each of coriander, chili, turmeric and salt. Mix well with the onions, then add the peas. Once they’re cooked, add the potatoes and combine everything to an even mass (probably stir in some warm water to make the mass softer). Add 1tsp garam masala powder, 2tbs chopped coriander leaves, 1tbs chopped mint leaves, and the juice of 1/2 lemon (or, for authenticity fans, 1tsp mango powder)

Take a store-bought samosa wrapper (usually 5x5in squares). There are different folding techniques; this one worked best for me. I made 18 samosas.

Either fry them in oil until golden brown, or oven-bake them at 180C/350F for 30 minutes.

    Vegetable oil (for pan)
    1 pound ground beef chuck (20% fat)
    Kosher salt
    4 slices American cheese
    4 potato rolls, toasted
    Ketchup, mayonnaise, shredded iceberg lettuce, and dill pickle slices (for serving)

Recipe Preparation

    Heat a cast-iron griddle or large heavy skillet over medium-high until very hot, about 2 minutes, then lightly brush with vegetable oil. Divide ground beef into 4 equal portions (do not form patties).

    Working in batches if needed, place portions on griddle and smash flat with a spatula to form 4"-diameter patties (craggy edges are your friend). Season liberally with salt and cook, undisturbed, until outer edges are brown, about 2 minutes. Flip patties, season with salt, and place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese droops and burgers are medium-rare, about 1 minute.

    Serve patties on rolls with ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, and pickles.

### Tacos Al Pastor
```
Tacos al Pastor by Tasty

Serves 10-12

Ingredients:
5 pounds boneless pork shoulder
3 tablespoons achiote paste
2 tablespoons guajillo chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon oregano
1 tablespoon cumin
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon pepper
¾ cup white vinegar
1 cup pineapple juice
1 pineapple, skinned and sliced into 1-inch rounds
1 thick wooden skewer, trimmed to the height of your oven
10-12 small corn tortillas
1 white onion, chopped finely
1 cup cilantro, chopped finely
1 cup salsa of your choice

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C.

Slice the pork shoulder into about 1-cm slices, then transfer to a large dish or bowl.

In a bowl, combine the achiote powder, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper, vinegar, and pineapple juice, mashing and stirring until smooth with no lumps.

Pour the marinade over the pork, then toss the pork slices to make sure that they are all coated on all sides. Wrap the dish/bowl in cling film then marinate the pork for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.

On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or foil, place down a slice or two of the pineapple. Take a wooden skewer and push it directly in the middle of the pineapple.

Remove the pork from the fridge and push the slices through the skewer, layering one after the other until there is a 1-inch gap at the top. Push another pineapple slice on top.

Bake for about an hour and a half, until slightly charred on the outside and deep red.

Rest the meat for about 10 minutes, then carve off thin slices of the pork.

Slice off thin pieces of the roasted pineapples as well.

To assemble and serve, place some pork on the tortillas, followed by a few pieces of pineapple, a sprinkle of onions, a pinch of cilantro, then a small spoonful of the salsa.

### Thai Lettuce Wraps
```
Ingredients

    1 head iceberg lettuce
    1 can chickpeas
    1/4 cup peanuts
    1 small avocado
    2 carrots
    1/4 white onion
    3 stalks green onion
    1 cup brown rice
    2 cups water (for rice)

Thai-inspired peanut sauce

    2/3 cup coconut milk
    2/3 cup peanut butter
    1 inch ginger
    2/3 cloves garlic
    2 tbsp gluten free tamari or soy sauce
    1 tbsp chili sesame oil (substitute sesame oil)
    1 tbsp brown sugar
    2 tbsp rice vinegar
    1 tsp red pepper flakes
    1/4 tsp salt
    1 tsp black pepper

Instructions

    Boil the rice. Put the one part brown rice and two parts water in a medium sized pot and cook the rice over medium high heat. Wait until the water starts to boil then lower the heat to low and put a lid on the pot. Simmer the rice for 20 minutes with the lid on. While your rice is cooking you can prepare the rest of the lettuce wraps.

    Prepare the lettuce for the lettuce wraps. Wash the head of lettuce and dry it. Carefully peel off one leaf at a time. If you are using a small head of lettuce the lettuce leaves might be an appropriate size already. If the lettuce leaves are too large to easily hold in the palm of your hand then you should carefully cut the leaves in half.

    Chop the carrots, onions, green onions, avocado, garlic, and peanut sauce.

    Combine all of the ingredients for the peanut sauce then mix the chickpeas, peanuts, and chopped vegetables into the peanut sauce.

    Assemble the lettuce wraps by adding a large scoop of rice and the chickpea mixture into the lettuce wraps.

### Tofu Crumbles (Chick fil A style)
Use for nachos
```
I used half a block of extra firm tofu, lightly pressed. Crumble it up in a bowl, drizzle some soy sauce over it and a tiny bit of pickle juice. Season generously with adobo, garlic powder, paprika, and chili powder. Add about a tablespoon of cornstarch and half a tablespoon of any neutral oil. Toss until everything is well coated. I air fryed this at 400 F for about 15 minutes, but baking or pan frying would work just as well!

### Gyoza
```
Ingredients :

For the paste :

    250g flour

    125g hot water (but not boiling water) Or you may find gyosas paste in some supermarkets. For the filling :

    1 oignon

    garlic as you like

    ~ 300g of grinded meat (I used pork)

    1/4 of a cabbage

    Sesam oil

    Nuoc mam sauce

    Salt / pepper

    Coriander

Instructions : Paste : mixed the flour and the hot water until you have a nice texture (smooth and a bit elastic) then let stand in the fridge for 30min. Then spread the paste as thin as you can. The thinner it is, the better it will be.

Filling : finely chop all the ingredients to have a continuous texture : all the ingredients must have the same size. Dose the nuoc mam and sesame oil so that the filling paste together. It shouldn’t has to be dry neither trickle. Then make the gyosas using the palm of your hand. If necessary add water where you need the dought to paste.

Heat the sesam oil in a pan (medium + heat ), add the gyosas. Once they are grilled, flop them. Once both sides are grilled put the fire down, add water (~2/3 cm of a glass of water), salt (be careful because nuoc mam is already salty), peper and cover it to steam the filling. After 7/8 min after the covering, they might be ready.

I suggest you to cook a bowl of vinegar rice to go with your gyosas

( I used sugared soya sauce to soak my gyosas )

### Vegetable Dumplings
```
Ingredients
For the dumpling wrappers (alternatively, you can just buy a package of pre-made dumpling wrappers):

    3 1/2 cups all purpose flour (450g)
    1 cup tepid water (plus 2 tablespoons)

For the filling:

    3 tablespoons oil (plus ¼ cup)
    1 tablespoon ginger (minced)
    1 large onion (chopped)
    2 cups shiitake mushrooms (chopped)
    1 1/2 cups cabbage (finely shredded)
    1 1/2 cups carrot (finely shredded)
    1 cup garlic chives (Chinese chives, finely chopped)
    1/2 teaspoon white pepper
    2 teaspoons sesame oil
    3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
    2 tablespoon soy sauce
    1 teaspoon sugar
    salt (to taste)

Instructions

    Start by making the dough for the dumpling wrappers. Put the flour in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add the water to the flour and knead into a smooth dough. This process should take about 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for an hour.
    In the meantime, make the filling. In a wok or large skillet over medium high heat, add 3 tablespoons oil and add the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the onions and stir-fry until translucent.
    Add the chopped mushrooms and stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid released by the mushrooms has cooked off.
    Add the cabbage and carrots and stir-fry for another 2 minutes, until the veggies are tender and all the liquid released has been cooked off. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large mixing bowl and allow to cool.
    To the bowl, add the chopped chives, white pepper, sesame oil, shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and sugar. Season with salt to taste (though the soy sauce will usually add enough salt to the filling), and stir in the last 1/4 cup of oil.
    To assemble the dumplings, cut the dough into small tablespoon-sized pieces. Roll each out into a circle, and pleat the dumplings (see this post for step-by-step photos on how to fold a dumpling). Continue assembling until you've run out of filling and/or dough.
    To cook the dumplings, steam them or pan-fry them. To steam, put the dumplings in a steamer lined with a bamboo mat, cabbage leaf, or cheese cloth, and steam for 15-20 minutes.
    To pan-fry, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a non-stick pan over medium high heat. Place the dumplings in the pan and allow to fry for 2 minutes. Pour a thin layer of water into the pan, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Allow dumplings to steam until the water has evaporated. Remove the cover, increase heat to medium-high and allow to fry for a few more minutes, until the bottoms of the dumplings are golden brown and crisp.
    Serve with our favorite dumpling sauce!

### Wontons
```
wontons:

    yves ground “meat”

    veggies: carrots, cabbage, onions & garlic

    a bunch of spices and a tiny bit of vegan broth !

    wrapped in a flour based wrapper (there’s tons of easy recipes to see online for this or you can even buy a pack of them from almost any grocery store for $1-$2)

    steamed in a bamboo steamer for 15 mins

soup:

    vermicelli noodles

    veggies: bok choy, broccoli, seaweed, cabbage, onion, garlic

    spices

    vegan bouillon

I don’t measure when I make food and do it all to taste

steps:

First I made the wonton wrappers (you can find so many recipes online or buy premade frozen ones for only $1-$2 for 40-50 wrappers!!).

I put ground “meat”, cabbage, carrots, garlic, onion in my food processor and chopped it finely. Once done with that, I bring it all to a bowl and bring it to my island where the wrappers are. I take one wrapper at a time, place it on the counter so it’s a square, have a small bowl of water sitting beside me so I can dip my index finger in the water and rub it on the top outer corners of the wonton so when I wrap it, it sticks together! I put a little spoonful of the meat mixture (I don’t measure but once you make one or two you’ll see how much will be perfect for the size of your wrappers) and I fold it. It may be tricky to explain how I fold it in text so I would just honestly look at a picture guide (that’s what I did)!! It took me folding about 5-6 before I figured it out nicely by myself (this was the first time I’ve made them)!!

After all of them are folded, I just put a pan of water on my stove and set it to boil and filled my bamboo steamer with my wontons and let it steam for 15 minutes!! It’s quite simple and very relaxing, I just responded to in a comment above yours what spices I used !

after I make large meals I put all the excess into meal prep containers and take one nice photo like this! this has been feeding me, my roommate, my partner & guests for 3 days so far:)

the sauces are a homemade teriyaki honey garlic & a sweet spicy pineapple !!

Stir gently until your udon noodles are separated and pliable. This should take 1 - 2 minutes. They come precooked so avoid overcooking them as they can get too soft.
    Rinse and drain your noodles under cold water. If not using right away, drizzle on a little bit of oil to keep them from sticking.

Stir Fry

    Heat your pan over high heat and add the oil. Add in the ground meat and stir fry for 1 minute before adding the rest of your vegetables. Stir fry together for 2 to 3 minutes and then add in the noodles and sauce. Continue stir frying for about 3 minutes or until well combined. Serve immediately.

## Sauce

### Cheese Sauce (Vegan)
```
Toss all of these ingredients into your Instant Pot: 5oz diced butternut squash (I buy precut bags for convenience. You can use fresh or frozen pieces), 12oz diced Yukon Gold potatoes, 1/2 med chopped sweet onion, 4 tsp fresh garlic, 1/2 cup raw cashews, 3/4 cup nutritional yeast, 1/2 Tbs salt, 2 Tbs lemon juice, 1 cup almond milk, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin. And 3/4 cup water.

Cook on High pressure for 7min. I let it vent steam naturally, but if you're in a hurry you can use the pressure release valve once done.

Toss the contents of the Instant Pot into a blender and blend (carefully bc it's HOT!). Also add 2 Tbs white or yellow miso. If it's too thick, add up to 1/4 cup water.

>
> Instructions
>
>     Place all ingredients for the spicy sauce in a saucepan or skillet. Cook over medium heat to bring it to sizzle and then lower the heat and keep stirring to let the sugar melts and take care not to burn the chili flakes and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes and then remove from the heat. Have a taste and adjust seasonings as needed. It should be spicy, savory, with just a hint of sweetness and tang
>     This can be kept in a glass jar. Let it cools down and keep in the fridge for 2-3 weeks

### California Roll in a Bowl

```
For the sushi rice: Make 2 cups of rice in a rice cooker. Heat up ¼ cup of rice vinegar in a small saucepan and dissolve 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. When the rice is done, pour into the rice (to taste) and mix it in with a rice paddle.

For the sriracha mayo, just mix sriracha into mayo to taste!

For the bowl, I used salad mix, cucumber, carrots, imitation crab, and avocado (not pictured because I’ll add it in right before eating). Garnished with sesame seeds and green onion.

### Fruit Roll Ups
```
Keyword fruit roll ups, homemade fruit roll ups
Prep Time 5 minutes
Cook Time 4 hours
Total Time 4 hours 5 minutes
Servings 2 - 3
Ingredients

8 oz strawberries (stems trimmed)
1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
3 tbsp sugar (optional)

Instructions

Place the trimmed strawberries in a blender or food processor and puree them for a minute or so until smooth. You don’t want any strawberry chunks in the mixture.
Transfer the strawberry puree to a saucepan and add the lemon juice and sugar, if using. Turn the heat to medium high, and cook the mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the mixture is thick and jammy. The goal here is to cook out much of the moisture.
Preheat the oven to 170 degrees F, or as low as your oven will go, making sure it’s less than 200 degrees at the highest.
Spread the strawberry jam into a rectangle shape onto a baking pan lined with a silpat or parchment paper. You may use an offset spatula or a regular spatula to help spread the mixture as evenly as possible, until the rectangle is about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind the fruit leather will lose some of its thickness in the oven as it dehydrates, so make sure that none of the jam is so thin that you can see through it as you spread.
Cook in the oven for 3-4 hours, until the fruit mixture no longer feels sticky, just a bit tacky. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely. Transfer to a cutting board lined with wax paper, and use a pizza cutter to cut long strips. Roll them up into the fruit rollups, and enjoy!
