## Performance

> Heck, I drop mine all the way to 2.5 watts for Stardew Valley, Baldur's Gate, System Shock 2 and some other titles lol I mostly play older favorites over the years so I mostly game with low TDP. I'll set my Win 2 at 3.5 watts which is the setting I use for games like the Mass Effect series and Dragon Age Origins and some other light 3D gaming.

> Combined with a 30 FPS cap, 2.5 watts, low screen brightness and little to no background apps, I can game for a good 8 hours depending on the title. Desktop usage is closer to 10 hours.
>
> I'm not the average use case for this machine I don't think. Didn't stop me from getting the third cooling mod though lol 2.5 watts and that thing installed, woo boy. nice and cool!
