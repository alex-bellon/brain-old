## Ender 3
- [Change boot screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/ob7soq/reminder_that_you_can_make_custom_bootscreens/)
  - > To make a bootscreen you need a black and white bmp file with the right resolution, for an Ender 3 its 128x64, upload it to https://marlinfw.org/tools/u8glib/converter.html. Then select Marlin 1.x or 2.x, binary, and boot. Put the file in the same folder as you configuration.h and uncomment (delete the // before the #) “#define SHOW_CUSTOM_BOOTSCREEN” in configuration.h then rebuild your firmware.

  > To make the image I used GIMP with a 1280x640 canvas, added the bency and robot, converted it to black and white and then changed the resolution to 128x64 to see how it looks, undo, thicken lines, and repeat until you get the results you want then export as a bmp. GIMP does not do low resolution text very well so I then opened it in pain and added the text.
